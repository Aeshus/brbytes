# Brbytes

This is my exploration into learning BrBytes, a Haskell-derivative producted by LSU.

It's based off of Google's Codeworld but also has some extra packages for use in their curriculum.

You can run the code here by going to [https://www.brbytes.org/cw21/#](https://www.brbytes.org/cw21/#).
